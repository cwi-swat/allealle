==============================================================================================================================================

Many interesting problems have relational (graph-like) structures. Relational model finders help you define and solve these problems in a natural way. <sup>1</sup> AlleAlle is such a relational model finder.

AlleAlle offers a language which combines first order logic (FOL) and Codd's relational algebra (think databases and SQL) allowing for efficient encodings of many relational problems (take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/cwi-swat/allealle/tree/master/examples)). Next to that, AlleAlle allows for the expression of optimization objectives making it possible to solve optimization problems as well.

--1) A nice overview of problems and problem domains where relational model finders have been used can be found [here](http://alloytools.org/citations/case-studies.html).--
